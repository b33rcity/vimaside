# vimaside

A couple things going on here:

  * Test out Deoplete to see if it's worth switching off of YCM
  * Set up some features to make working with C a little easier
  * ACTUALLY use NerdTree
  
Eventually I'll pro'ly merge this vimrc with that in the bc_dotfiles or lt_dotfiles repos. Not sure which is the one I'm actually using right now....
